# 🌐 Developer Portfolio – Carlos Rojas

This is my personal portfolio built with **Next.js 14**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**, showcasing my featured projects, technologies I use, and contact information.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **Next.js 14** (App Router, Server Components)
- **TypeScript**
- **Tailwind CSS** (with custom animations and gradients)
- **Framer Motion** (for smooth UI animations)
- **Prisma** + **Supabase** (production-ready database)
- **Custom SVG icons**

## 🧩 Features

- Dynamic project section rendered from the database.
- Fully responsive layout with adaptive grid system.
- Smooth animations and visual effects (hover, scale, blur).
- Internal navigation with scroll-to-section behavior.
- Optimized images using Next.js `<Image />`.
- Modular, reusable code (ProjectCard, ProjectSection, HeroSection, etc).
